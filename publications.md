>"Most technical service areas accept the need for training, but the quality of that training can vary markedly. While budgets are a factor, they are only part of the bigger picture and this book demonstrates that training can be addressed without being defined by budget limitations." - Catherine Gilbert, _Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association_, April 2024

>“Well-researched and written, this slim volume delivers an excellent starting point for any library considering designing or reimagining a training program or project.” – Linda Frederiksen, _Library Journal reviews_, March 2023

>“The underpinning principles and concepts presented throughout the book are applicable to any library area. In fact, the re-envisioning of libraries as learning organizations where change is expected and anticipated demands a supportive framework for training librarywide. Creating a culture of continuous learning enables staff to adapt and make changes quickly, in technical services and every other area of the library.” — _Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship_, https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2023.2197806

My current big project is a new indie horror game where you play as Rat Boy returning to the city in search for his dead mom. In May I worked on designing the main character, Rat Boy, the NPCs he talks to, and the game start backgrounds and interactables. 

One of my favorite parts of making video games/apps is failing. Spectacularly. I have redesigned Rat Boy four times! Each iteration gets me closer to the final look of the game. The same goes with backgrounds. The coolest and most frustrating part of being an indie developer (of any kind) is that this type of work requires us to fail, to sandbox, to test, to debug, and ultimately to try again.  

Here's a wall of art that I made this month. 

ðŸ¤¯About the Project: I'm making a cozy-horror game. Currently working on art, interactables, character animations, and prototyping.

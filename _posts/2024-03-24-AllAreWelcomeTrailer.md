It's here! Check out the official gameplay trailer for "All Are Welcome," a psychological horror visual novel where museum visitors become the art.

I developed this game in 2023 as past of a data science fellowship and recently updated the game with lore, more gameplay, and this trailer. I ended up making a YouTube to share my game developments and trailers since itchio doesn't let users upload files themselves (what even???). Stay tuned for more dev updates on YouTube!

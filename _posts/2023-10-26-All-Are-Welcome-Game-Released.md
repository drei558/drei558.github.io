I'm excited to announce the full release of my LEADING fellowship [video game for free on itch.io](https://decolfutures.itch.io/all-are-welcome).

_All Are Welcome_ is a nonlinear psychological horror text-based video game that explores the horrors of the Black and Indigenous experience while touring a virtual reality art exhibition. Play as a Black climate refugee visiting the museum where visitors become the art. 

Click on the underlined words to play.

Content Warnings: The game contains depictions of death, body horror, and loud sounds. 

Many thanks to my fellow Virgo and esteemed peer, kYmberly Keeton; my fellowship site mentors, Dr. Synatra Smith, Holly Tomren, and Dr. Alex Wermer-Colan; and the many friends, family, and colleagues that helped demo and test the gameplay.

I'm preparing my year-end comic! I started making a comic strip three years ago to celebrate/self-reflect on the things I did professionally in the past 365 days that I really liked. Since I got into making indie video games, the comic has morphed into a chance to play (yes, like in a whimsical way) and make this a worthwhile mini-project to showcase my talents, skills, and career.

- How do you celebrate your work?
- What do you do outside a performance review to reflect?
- How do you find joy in your accomplishments?

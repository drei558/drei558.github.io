I saw the Museum Computer Network took down the online interactive booklet with my book chapter on open access issues and Indigenous collection management so I deposited a copy in Zenodo. The chapter's about open access policies, decolonization, and practical strategies for collection management: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17219710

Mobile Phones Just Got Spookier! The 1.1 update for Late Night Surfing is an android release of the game. I built all distributions of the game: PC, Mac, Linux, and now Android. 

I was annoyed I couldn't build an iOS version because I don't have a Mac and I'm not compelled enough to emulate ios for a game demo. For some reason I thought building for Android would be challenging. But then I realized...a video game is already an app...

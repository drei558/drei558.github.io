We received glowing reviews from players and the hype is still steadily growing. I'm sharing some of my favorite player reviews: 

>_"The story is chaos (in a good way), and the visuals are disgusting (also in a good way)."_

>_"You really do know how to seemingly take some of my worst fears ( walruses and spiders) and put them onto the screen."_

>_"Absolutely insane. I've never played a game like this, so well thought out. The story was impeccable. This game was probably the scariest work of art I've ever seen in my life, being that the monster was capitalism (doesn't get scarier than that tbh)."_

As this game jam ends, a new chapter begins in my data projects. Stay tuned next week for exciting news and terrifying 2D retro art for where hashtag#latenightsurfing is going next. ðŸ˜‰

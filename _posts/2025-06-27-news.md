**I Am Exhausted By You** is a zine for sharing my projects (writing, exhibits, proposals, and more) that never got published, which is exhausting. This is the first issue and I have several more lined up. 

I decided to self-publish in this format because like others in the data/DAM/research space, I put a significant amount of effort, time, and intention into work that never sees publication. I don't want the lack of pretty bylines or journal titles to stop me from sharing my work. This format is also fun! I got to put some of my digital art doodles into this, which makes me smile. ðŸ˜† 

[This issue features a short article titled, "Dear Survivors of the COVID-19 Pandemic Experience,"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15749735) that I wrote in December 2023 when I was wrapping up a data science fellowship project. Feel free to download and share.

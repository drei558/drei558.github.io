This book chapter has literally been five years in the making. My long-time collaborator, Kristen J. Nyitray, and I write about transliteracy skills behind an online tutorial in the Special Collections and University Archives at Stony Brook University in the upcoming IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) Publications book. The book _Libraries Empowering Society through Digital Literacy_ is expected to be published October 14, 2025.

An excerpt from the [press release](https://www2.archivists.org/recipients/2024/fellows-ernst-posner-award-dana-reijerkerk-caterina-m-reed): 
>"The article offers excellent and thoughtful advice on how this situation can be ameliorated. The SAA Awards Committee hopes that this article can serve as a wake-up call to repositories working with records documenting Native American/Indigenous/Tribal Communities and encourages them to implement the practical suggestions made in this article."

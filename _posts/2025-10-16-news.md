Hi, I'm Dana Reijerkerk, a data consultant, freelance digital asset manager, and indie developer with an affinity for leading data-driven projects, data migrations, assessments, analytics, and more. I have 10+ years global experience working remotely with nonprofits, cultural heritage institutions, film and media, and creatives. 

This year I've worked on some cool projects: 

- Did 2D illustration, art, & animation for a Nickelodeon-style strategy/auto-battler called Gretchen the Wretched in Super Sludge Clash: https://wujak.itch.io/super-sludge-clash 

- Created infographics for designing data models, taxonomies, and ontologies: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15749633

- Published an article in DAM News on open source DAM solutions: https://digitalassetmanagementnews.org/features/considerations-for-open-source-dam-solutions/

- QA'ed and archived 500 animation episodes in languages like Ewe, Ukrainian, and Arabic

- Traced data layers in a CMS including it's MySQL database, discovery layer, back-end, and front-end & exported 2TB of data for a system migration

- Gave a talk in the UK about the overlooked emotional labor of women archivists in relation to AI (artificial intelligence) technologies in September

I'm looking for fully remote contract, freelance, and part-time work. \

Happy New Years! Last year I focused a lot of my time and energy on sharing my expertise and knowledge across platforms like BlueSky and LinkedIn and at data conferences and events. I plan to reshape my newsletter this year to highlight more of that content I share elsewhere since most algorithms for socials don’t show everything I post. And not everyone can attend the events or conferences I appear at. 

In this issue I talk about: A Year in Review Comic, a paid Switzerland data fellowship opportunity, and $10 trainings with History Colorado. Read it for yourself: https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20260105

Did you even know I had a newsletter? I started it because I didn’t see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news, views, and tips to do data work 1-2 times a month.

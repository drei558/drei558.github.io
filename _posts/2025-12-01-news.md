I wrote about [why the disconnect/dissonance of DAM Fragmentation Crisis](https://digitalassetmanagementnews.org/features/why-the-disconnect-and-dissonance-of-the-dam-fragmentation-crisis-matters/) - the idea that a DAM hub is made of several disconnected systems mashed together is a norm - and was featured in DAM NEWS.

I didn't post much about my newest article from last week because of the US holiday week so let's talk about it now.

DAMS promise integrations with lots of different tools and CMS' and promise interoperability. The reality however is that DAMs are fragmented, fragile frameworks that rely on connecting to systems they have no control over or ability to adequately invest in. DAMs that attempt to become an organization’s entire digital ecosystem–the complete set of different digital repositories, productivity apps, and other computer systems–fall short because the cost of maintenance isn’t sustainable or realistic.

- What frustrates you when working with a DAM/CMS/database that acts as a data hub for your entire organization? 
- How often do you think about APIs? 
- Which "fragment" of this fragmentation crisis matters most to your work?

WIP of some of the things you'll interact with in game, backgrounds, and characters the player will meet. 

I decided to keep the Rat Boy you play/move with as a "cute" character, but everyone else in the world will look gritty and more detailed. The juxtaposition is intentional and meant to make you feel helpless. 

I wrote the story outline last week and began making the start of the game. I plan to make backgrounds 1920 x 1080 and cut to a 1040 x 1040 overlay to play mini-games/interact with objects. I still need to pick a font and add text to the polaroids introducing players to MOTHER.

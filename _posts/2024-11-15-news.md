I uploaded a FREE TO READ version of my literature review article I published in 2022: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14171149

This article is for you if you're interested in seeing what the literature says about how archives and libraries connect with the landmark 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). It's a good source for cites for your own research. 

I remember writing this because NAGPRA isn't interpreted to cover materials held by archives and libraries and it excludes a legal mandate to repatriate to source communities without federal recognition. ![AM_NAGPRAarticle_promo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb92b763-a53c-40e7-907d-f7ad2a980317)

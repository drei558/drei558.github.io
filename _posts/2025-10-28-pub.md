Sometimes publishing takes a very very long time. My book chapter, "Enhancing Student Transliteracy Through Archives: Designing an OER for Primary Source Mastery" just released! I wrote this in 2021...so it's not too relevant to the kind of work I'm doing now, but still an interesting read. 

The chapter is a case study analysis/data benchmark of an archival literacy OER (open education resource) emphasizing systems used for design, user experience, and how to develop immersive design with primary sources.

Some takeaways: \
👉Just because millennials/gen z grew up using the Internet doesn't mean they're inherently great at using digital technologies like OERs \
⭐Archival instruction in academic libraries is just as important as other forms of library instruction \
💻Primary source literacy can be taught asynchronously with self-tests, google forms, and good UI practices

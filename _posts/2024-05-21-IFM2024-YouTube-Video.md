The Relational Possibilities Project is LIVE. We're presenting the project at the _Interactive Film and Media International Conference_ in June!

[Check out our video](https://youtu.be/kgLLo77dJUs?feature=shared) explaining how we came up with the ideas for data storytelling with artificial intelligence on YouTube. 

And if youâ€™re interested in hosting a virtual workshop on using generative AI for data literacy (LIKE OUR PROJECT!), you can get in contact with The Creative CoLab at danareijerkerk@gmail.com.

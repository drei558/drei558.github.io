Come see a sneak peak at the WIP game build for my game jam and check out curated news on a paid art critic fellowship, remote collections volunteering, and mutual aid networks: [https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20250919](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20250919)

Did you know I have a newsletter? I started it because I didn’t see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on educational opportunities, industry updates, and behind-the-scenes content of my projects.

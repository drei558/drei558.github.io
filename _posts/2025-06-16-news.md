**Ever wonder how the back-end of your CMS, DAM, or Website works?** No one size data model fits all data. If you work with digital assets or manage digital content, you likely have different data needs than your colleagues in marketing, management, and IT. I made this infographic during a recent client prospect call to show how data conceptual models are important to thinking through the logic of managing your data. 

I partner with clients of all sizes to assess and design sustainable data systems. I’m here to help you through your next database migration, assess your multi-departmental data workflows, and walk you through the technical jargon in that vendor/developer meeting you’re dreading.

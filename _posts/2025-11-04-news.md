_I Am Exhausted By You_ is a zine for sharing my projects (writing, exhibits, proposals, and more) that never got published. This issue features a short horror story called "Do You Like My Art?" intended to be an extension of my meta-creative data science project, [_Relational Possibilities (2023 - 2024)_](https://tinyurl.com/thecreativecollabproject). It's also an experiment into how I got into making video games!

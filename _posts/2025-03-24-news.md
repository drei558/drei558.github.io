ðŸŽ‰I started my next indie video game ðŸŽ‰where I'm embracing the exhaustion with my 2D characters. I spent yesterday drawing 8 characters and the first background. I'm on the fence on height between them, but will probably keep them small and my environment big. My next step is to draw the walk cycles and put them together in OpenToonz.

In 2023 I started _The Creative CoLab_, a creative partnership with the great [kYmberly Keeton](https://kreativeyoungmillionaire.net/). Since last year, we've experimented with generative AI, video game design, comic books, and digital projects. kYmberly inspired me to look at what the IIIF viewer can do. The [_Black Beauty Culture_](https://github.com/drei558/Black_Beauty_Culture_IIIF_Project) Project in GitHub remixes items that highlight Black beauty and fashion from Brown University's repository, the Internet Archive, the National Museum of African American History & Cultures, and Library of Congress' digital collections.

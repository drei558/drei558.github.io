I published my poster/infographic on designing realistic data systems for multi-departmental workflows on Zenodo. It explains entity relationship diagrams for database design using the FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) Conceptual Model. 

Conceptual models are not right or wrong, but templates to custom to your data set. This poster offers three examples of FRBRized film screening data, tips for database assessment, and core design points to frame your own data assessments.

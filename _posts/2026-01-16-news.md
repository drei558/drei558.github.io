One of my long-term contracts leading a database migration has ended. For the last two years I reviewed and assessed data management systems, vetted and recommended new ones, and migrated data from CollectiveAccess to TMS Collections and ArchivEra. This project involved project management, DAM, systems administration, development, configuring VPNs and SFPT access via remote tunnels, vendor negotiations, and technical writing. 

I’m available for work immediately and can’t wait to see what this year holds. I'm looking for freelance/consulting gigs, but I'm also open to contract and part-time work. 

You can reach me through DMs or my email danareijerkerk@gmail.com

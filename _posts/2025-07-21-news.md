Hello hello! I'm a data chameleon and someone who works as a data consultant, freelance digital asset manager, writer, and indie developer (full-stack, back-end, and video games). I just updated my portfolio and added a new page about the video games I've made since I'm spearheading two new 2d hand-drawn game projects. 

I do a variety of different data work like - design museum exhibits, make entity-to-entity relationship diagrams, lead data migrations, write journal articles, and more. 

Look me up if you're looking for a data peer or someone to work with on a contract, freelance, or part-time basis.

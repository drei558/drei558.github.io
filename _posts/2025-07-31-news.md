I'm speaking on the overlooked emotional labor of women in the archival profession and the risks that Artificial Intelligence (e.g. for metadata generation, reference chatbots) poses for exacerbating it at the "Experimental Archives Conferences" at Kingston University's School of Art in the UK September 11-12th. 


This is another extension of my 2024 Bloomsbury chapter on Archives and Emotional Labor that emphasized the practicalities of how a typical archive  uses AI for the work. The full book it appears in just won the Society of American Archivists Waldo Gifford Leland Award! 


So far the conference is all in person, but it's free to attend if you're local.

â˜•Indie game update â˜•: Rat Boy has entered the sewer. I finished another background and some interactable assets. I'm leaning more towards the horror in cozy-horror after I made Brainrot Rat whose brain leaks out of his ears. Next up is the sewer entrance. 

ðŸ˜„Game Deving ProgressðŸ˜„: I'm working on the art and character animations for my next cozy-horror game. Next stage is prototyping parallax backgrounds and character keyboard movement in Godot.

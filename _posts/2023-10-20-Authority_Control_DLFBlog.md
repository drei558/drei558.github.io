# About
In my latest article, "[Understanding constraints to adaptation using a community-centred toolkit](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2022.0391)," I discuss decolonizing ecological conservation adaptations to anthropomoric caused climate change in Indigenous communities. 

Many thanks to the Vezo people and my various international collaborators and co-authors, especially [Danielle C. Buffa](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9478-8470) and [Katharine E.T. Thompson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5892-536X) for the invitation to co-write.

I'm excited to promote my new best practices publication with my peers on the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Assessment Interest Group's (AIG) Metadata Working Group (MWG). In "[Issues in Authority Control: Case Studies in Name Authority Records and Platform User Experience Design](https://www.diglib.org/issues-in-authority-control-case-studies-in-name-authority-records-and-platform-user-experience-design/)," my esteemed colleagues disscuss data issues in Name Authority Records and how data impacts the user experience (UX) desgin of digital collections. 

Many thanks to Hannah Tarver, Annamarie Klose, Mandy Mastrovita, and Rebecca Fried. I helped edit and proof the cases.

The [DLF Assessment Interest Group's (AIG) Metadata Working Group (MWG)](https://wiki.diglib.org/Assessment:Metadata) aims to build guidelines, best practices, tools and workflows around the evaluation and assessment of metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories.

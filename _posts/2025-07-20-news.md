I totally forgot to post the link to my indie game festival page for "Hear You, Hear Me!" My art director Charles D. Jones and I submitted our psychological horror game to Toronto's SuperFEST and did an exhibitor interview. 

The game included full voice acting, point-and-click, Live 2D animation, and an original soundtrack. And it was all built in Ren'Py in 2 months!

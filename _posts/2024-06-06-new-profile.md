Behold my new profile photo! This was done by illustrator, artist, and game dev [Esskaden](https://esskaden.artstation.com/resume). I'm working with him on my new indie video game titled, "Hear Me, Hear You," which releases on Itchio July 1st. I love that he captured how I truly look and that he included one of my tattoos on my right arm!

***I Am Exhausted By You Vol.2*** is out! _I Am Exhausted By You_ is a zine for sharing my projects (writing, exhibits, proposals, and more) that never got published. This issue features a physical art exhibit design titled, "Water Connects Us," that I curated in November 2023 for the NYC Data Through Design (DxD) exhibit open call. Feel free to download and share. Feel free to download and share: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16422293](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16422293).

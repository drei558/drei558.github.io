I saw a call for help with data analysis last year in my email, so I joined up! I went to the first few meetings and volunteered to take on their messiest unstructed dataset from a survey sent out in 2021. I convinced the group at large to make dashboards in Looker Studio - - - to make the data stories more interesting!

I spent a lot of creative capital with these three women from across the East Coast for almost 12 months! I hope we work together again in the future. I liked how we sandboxed our ideas and found ways to make the costs of digitizing cultural heritage digestible and fun to read.

The full report and Looker dashboard will be uploaded to OSF in the next few weeks. Stay tuned for more development news by following my blog and [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/decolfutures/)!

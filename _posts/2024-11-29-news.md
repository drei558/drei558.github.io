My personal favorite publication of 2024 just dropped! In "Flexible Work Empowers: An Inclusive Strategy for Recruitment and Retention of Academic Librarians," my co-author and I talk about how academic libraries have been using flexible work arrangements (e.g. remote work, flextime, compressed work weeks) for over 30 years and why pretending it's impossible to do in the workplace today is an inclusivity issue.

You can [read the preprint for free on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14201599)!

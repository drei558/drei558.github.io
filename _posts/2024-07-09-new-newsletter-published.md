The latest issue of _DecolFutures_, a byte-sized newsletter for data topics, is out! It talks about game jams as data projects, a paid gig, a DAM webinar, and a course on Git. 

My newsletter is for you if you want to get thinking fuel or skill up about all things data.

Read all about it in the [July 2024 issue](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/game-jams-and-data-projects).

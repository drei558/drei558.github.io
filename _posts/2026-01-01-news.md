Happy New Year! I want to share [progress-to-date for a video game project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danareijerkerk_dont-talk-to-me-video-game-project-progress-to-date-activity-7412532080313577472-77oR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACMdDrsB0MBzZB4ByakUPmHPddP_ZEv8ccY) I've been working on for the last 8 months. My game, called Don't Talk To Me, is a Dungeons and Dragons-style turn based battler where you play as a rat lady fighting to get groceries with your low social battery. I've been having so much fun designing game menus, a battle system, and characters in this 90s cartoon world. 

Also, my books for 2026 are open. I’m looking for remote freelance/consulting, part-time, and contract work doing database migrations, data assessments, digital projects, development/programming, digital asset management, analytics, narrative design, or data storytelling. 

Have a cool project/kind of work not listed here in mind for me? DM me anyway!

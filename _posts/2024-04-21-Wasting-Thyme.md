I submitted my team game to the Cozy Spring Jam 2024! I worked with a great group of strangers on the Internet who were located in all different time zones. We cobbled it together in 4 hours - I got the art assets at 7am, the music at noon, and submitted around 1:30pm. [Play the game](https://decolfutures.itch.io/wasting-thyme) for free on itch.io!

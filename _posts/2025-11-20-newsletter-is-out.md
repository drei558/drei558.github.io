It's been a whirlwind of a month with my brain focusing on writing, awards, and the news about the outages at Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare. This month's newsletter focuses on that! Check it out: https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20251120

Did you know I have a newsletter? I started it because I didn’t see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on educational opportunities, industry updates, and behind-the-scenes content of my projects.

It's Thursday and here's where I'm at in developer progress for my DnD-style (Dungeons-and-Dragons) battler, Don't Talk To Me.

I'm still changing the UI. I made the inventory bigger with buttons you click to move up/down. You click the grocery list icon (top right) to view your quests. I'm working on the logic for all mouse hover and clicks user inputs. I'm also fixing menus and designing a modal menu for inspect/talk when you hover over NPCs and objects in the game. 

And meet Beatrice, your pregnant rogue class companion. I decided to give players the option to pick up a companion to fight that is (1) a class they can't play as and (2) is super pregnant (you often don't see playable pregnant characters in games).<img width="653" height="479" alt="A pregnant cartoony dog-like woman character" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf3a51a6-4bcd-4411-a439-78ea154ccdb6" />

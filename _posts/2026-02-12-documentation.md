Let's talk about documentation. Whether it's client work, group projects, or looking at your aunt's personal finances, documentation matters. 

Keep a list of software and IT systems that you pay for/use. Write yourself a narrative about it. You don't need to know how tech works to stay organized.

Here's some easy templates. 


Make a bullet list of your:
- website platform (e.g. WordPress, Drupal)
- email client (e.g. Outlook, Gmail)
- web hosting (e.g. custom domains and email domains)
- analytic platforms (e.g. Google Analytics)
- databases (e.g. AEM, Bynder, TMS, Archive-It)

Write down what version they are. This is important! System updates (going from version 1.1 to 1.5) can cause things to break or not work. 

More advanced lists could include:
- SSL renewal process (your website's "https" in the URL)
- server and version (e.g. virtual Linux server)
- remote access set up (e.g. VPNs, remote server connections)
- names of vendors you work with (e.g. network security, system updates)

How does this help you? Troubleshooting tech problems - from data export errors, to emails going straight to spam, to server crashes - starts with making this list. You save yourself time and back-and-forth communication if you proactively document your data ecosystem.

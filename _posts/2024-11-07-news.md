Go search for a job that asks you to make metadata (data about data) for digital assets. What words do you see? Itâ€™s mostly semantics and different expectations. The words we use to describe metadata work are industry specific and come with assumptions of what systems, assets, metadata standards, and job titles that you should expect. 

Read more about these differences and how to demonstrate your expertise in metadata, DAM, and cataloging in the [latest issue of my decolFutures newsletter](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/241107).

decolFutures is a space to learn about practical ways to decolonize your research and data work lives with byte-sized drabbles about the daily life of a data professional.

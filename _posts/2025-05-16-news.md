I love writing-stories, poems, museum exhibit text, articles, book chapters, and more. But it may seem daunting. There are a lot of different ways and venues that you can publish your work. Publishing helps build your portfolio, which is important if your data work isn’t something inherently visual or you can’t share screenshots/examples because of confidentiality issues. 

If you’re unsure where to even start, begin with a magazine or newsletter. Magazines and newsletters require low-word counts and are typically regional. These venues showcase practical work so write about a project you’re working on, how you approach finding aids, or that new acquisition of irregular formats your Archive received.

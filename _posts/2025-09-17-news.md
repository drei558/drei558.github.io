I updated my portfolio and realized yet again that I do a lot of different, diverse data things. This year I focused more on developer projects so I added an entire page dedicated to video game development, but kept my other back-end and front-end developer work under "data projects." I'm also really into these Markdown tags I found on GitHub and I added them in different styles/colors to different webpages. 

I spent a lot of time in SQL, working with VPNs and the command line, SFTPing, troubleshooting virtual servers, and reverse engineering content management systems to export data. From a taxonomy standpoint, this felt different than creating software/applications in the form of a video game. 

I'm also in polish pass mode for art assets in the 2025 Robot Party Game Jam and made three new mystery Skremplets (monster characters) and started on illustration scenes, extras, and stretch goals. This jam I made my first ever tile sets and got to learn the sheer amount of copies with slight variants that go into making a 2d game. For example, I've made 16 trash cans: empty, with trash, with a special hidden sweater x 5 different colors.

The art for one parallax background and Rat Boy's walk animation is done. I didn't like how un-rat-like Rat Boy looked so I changed Rat Boy's art to look more grungy and hungry. My next step is do the background for the other surface places. I'm thinking about which interactable objects I want to add to my scenes. I want to try both a mini-puzzle interactable (the trashcan) and a "click and see some text" interactable. My goal is to make some barebones art so I can start coding the different pieces in Godot.

This is also my first time messing around in OpenToonz, and the learning curve is steep. I redrew the walking key frames to add arm movement and added 7 more frames to make walking look more natural. More frames made the animation smoother, but I'm not too happy with the one foot's smoothness.

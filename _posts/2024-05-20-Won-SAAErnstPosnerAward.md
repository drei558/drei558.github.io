My article titled “Archives, Decolonization, and the Politics of Tribal Sovereignty” won the prestigious Society of American Archivists award for an outstanding essay published in _The American Archivist_ that deals with some facet of archival administration, history, theory, and/or methodology.

I wrote an analysis of the federal recognition process that Indigenous communities of all recognition statuses are forced to go through in the US and published it in _The American Archivist_. This is one of my favorite publications because I got to pull together my Indigenous Studies expertise with my data expertise. I got the news TODAY! Some of my favorite archivists and archival scientists have won this award!!

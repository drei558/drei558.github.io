My goal for 2024 is to give _big_, _loud_, _proud_ **Virgo** energy.

A good friend and colleague shared her New Years tradition with me. Her New Years Day is February 1st - the first day of Black History Month. It reminded me that holidays are cultural constructs. When I called her to wish her happy new year, it made me feel, "Happy. New. Year."

Taking a page from her book, I'm starting anew! I'm going all in on the career term "data professional" under the name decol Futures - a play on the idea of imagined decolonized future realities.

I hope to explore ideas like:
- What does it mean to work in the cultural heritage sector?
- What is a data professional?
- How can I navigate data freelancing and consulting work in a field that is predicated on temporary, term, and grant-funded labor?
- What makes me feel proud to associate with labels like "librarian," "archivist," "curator," "designer"?

We’ve got news. We (Dana Reijerkerk and [Audrey Walstrom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audreywalstrom/)) partnered up to produce a new [white paper made for healthcare professionals to clarify ambiguity about AI in healthcare data operations and explain the ways that AI is used with healthcare data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18789922). This white paper is relevant to physicians, counselors, psychologists, 3rd Party HIPPA-compliant vendors, data managers, AI developers, and health science librarians.

AI is rapidly changing and conversations about using AI in healthcare operations are evolving. Many data management tools, including ERPs, video conferencing softwares, or professional development training sites for medical professionals already integrate AI with limited or no opt-out settings.

GenAI has fundamentally changed global data operations, including Internet traffic and the costs of IT systems. AI-based data operation workflows, like diagnosing patients or analyzing diagnostic imaging, impact patient outcomes and treatments.

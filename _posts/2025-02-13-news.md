Did you know I have a newsletter? I started it because I didn't see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing kind of data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on:
- educational opportunities
- industry updates
- behind the scenes content of my current projects

Like what you're hearing? [Subscribe to the newsletter](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/subscribe)!

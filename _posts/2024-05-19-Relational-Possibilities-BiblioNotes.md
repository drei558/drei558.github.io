The Relational Possibilities project showcases the unparalleled artistic and expressive capabilities of employing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) imagery and audio technologies to facilitate immersive and interactive design in film and media. As the seminal collaboration between Dana Reijerkerk and kYmberly Keeton (The Creative CoLab), _Relational Possibilities: A Remix of Aesthetic Forms Through Indigeneity and Blackness_ is a meta creative digital work between two researchers, writers, and artists from different races using generative AI. 

Relational Possibilities is a digital community archive data science project that explores community relations and futurist realities of Indigeneity and Blackness through artists, writers, and public art in Philadelphia. Our research-creation entails the practical development of a collaborative data media art endeavor centered around the Black and Indigenous communities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US.

The Creative CoLab is currently sharing this research and engaging the community. They presented their research virtually in March at the BitCurator Forum and Research Data Access and Preservation (RDAP) Summit. They will present at the 6th Interactive Film & Media International Virtual Conference in June (free virtual event), the University of North Texas School of Information, and Barnard College/ Columbia University in summer 2024. 

If youâ€™re interested in hosting a virtual workshop on using generative AI for data literacy, you can get in contact with The Creative CoLab at danareijerkerk@gmail.com.

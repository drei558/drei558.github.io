I almost didnâ€™t get a second issue out this month because I competed in the Spooktober Visual Novel Jam.In this issue I talk about the weirdness surrounding digital asset manager jobs versus developer jobs and how maybe they're the same thing. Read all about it in [the latest issue](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/2024-10-01). I also made this sick meme!

As a small business owner and a freelancer, I know how to make your systems work for you - whether it be helping you migrate data or digital assets, assess why you have several database systems that don't talk to each other, or writing reports or slide decks for your data projects. 

I know how to talk systems, DAM, archiving, and creative workflows like animation. Data work doesn't care to be siloed into neat categories like just developer work or just content management so I offer a mix of different kinds of data services.

I'm especially interested in independent contractor projects involving database migrations, data assessments, digital projects, development/programming, digital asset management, analytics, narrative design, or data storytelling.

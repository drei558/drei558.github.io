Come behind the scenes with me and my new zine about my unpublished data work and check out 5 funded data fellowship opportunities: [https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20250710](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20250710)

**Did you know I have a newsletter?** I started it because I didn’t see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on educational opportunities, industry updates, and behind-the-scenes content of my projects.

Formed in 2023, The Creative CoLab is the creative data science hive mind of Dana Reijerkerk and Dr. kYmberly Keeton. Our next collaborative project launches March 5, 2025. 

We've been working behind-the-scenes to branch off from our first project with something entirely new for 2025. We've made a logo (thank you, kYmberly!), website, and requested a ISSN (spoilers?). I'm so excited for you to see what we have planned. 

Our last collaboration, Relational Possibilities, was an award-winning meta creative data science project on Philadelphia's Black and Indigenous public art(ists). Check it out for yourself at [https://tinyurl.com/thecreativecollabproject](https://tinyurl.com/thecreativecollabproject)

I started making video games in 2023 because of a data science fellowship. I could do any project and I decided to make a branching narrative game in Twine. Ever since, I use video games as a way to express things happening in my life and explore the complexities of human behaviors. 

This year I’m making a solo-dev game where players explore a sewer and it’s deep dark horrors as Rat Boy, an embodiment of feeling burnt out and dissatisfaction with the world he lives in. The game colors will change based on how deep Rat Boy goes in the sewer and within his fractured psyche. Players will interact with the world by rummaging through things like a rat. 

I’m making all the art this time; I’m using this is as opportunity to play and learn new skills in tools like Krita, OpenToonz, and Blender. It’s so refreshing to program, project plan, etc. while making art.

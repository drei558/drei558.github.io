I submitted my first game to a game jam! Game jams are short themed competitions where game developers create a video game from scratch during the set timeframe. The rules for my jam were to create an underwater horror game in any engine with a choice of three elements. I chose gameplay from the monster's perspective.

Check out my dev log on the itch.io game page if you're interested in my thoughts on my process for my new game **The Creatures From Below**.

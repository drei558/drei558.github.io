I'll be speaking in September at the Centre for Public History, Queen's University Belfast about Artificial Intelligence and Archivist's Emotional Labor with my long-time research collaborator Kristen J. Nyitray! 

This presentation draws from research we conducted about archives and emotions in our forthcoming Bloomsbury book chapter.

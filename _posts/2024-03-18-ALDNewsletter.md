In December 2023, I became a Collaborative Partner of [_ART | library deco_](https://artlibrarydeco.space/), an online African American virtual art library, digital gallery, and repository. I'm currently working on monthly newsletters and web comics.

It's so much fun to sandbox graphic design and digital storytelling that's creative yet commercial.

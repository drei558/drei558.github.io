From 2019 - 2023 I presented at the top venues in the data field about practical ways to manage digital assets across different sectors like entertainment, film, cultural heritage, and animation. If you're a digital asset manager, you often have to assess and evaluate your content and present this in layman's terms to colleagues and higher ups that often lack the technical data expertise you possess.

It can be challenging to figure out how to present and communicate your work. I made a template to help you! It's perfect for professionals in corporate, museums, archives, libraries, and not-for-profits wanting to assess, evaluate, and communicate findings about your digital asset management work.

For $10, you get an editable report template, a FAQ with answers to top questions for your organization's leaders, and two comprehensive data assessment methods. Grab a copy for yourself on [my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/s/42785ce4d1).

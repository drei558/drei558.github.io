Another talk done! This talk was about how **AI in archives introduces a depersonalized mode of collection processing and interaction** that sidelines human connection which ironically intensifies emotional labor demands. This theme of my research/writing explores the **dichotomy between "new" tech that isn't actually new and how it affects cultural heritage sector labor**. 

Archivists have been using AI for years often in the form of built-in database or DAM tools like:
- automatic transcription
- file naming upon upload
- image recognition

While AI is not new to the profession and archivists are not developers of the technologies, AI is being pushed upon us. **Archivists are challenged with how to meaningfully apply AI when the tools arenâ€™t built for us or by us.** I find this aspect of tech isn't considered or talked about often.

For the last few years, I presented different aspects of a Bloomsbury Publishing chapter I co-wrote about the "hidden" emotional labor in archival work. I pre-recorded a talk titled "**Books, Bodies, and Bots: The Overlooked Emotional Labour of Women Archivists - From Humans to Machines**" for the 2025 Experimental Archives Conference at Kingston University, UK.

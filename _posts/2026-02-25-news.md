The Western Archives Institute is running this summer! I'm freelancing as the online program coordinator and I'll be attending class with you and helping you with tech issues.

It'll be fully remote in PST hours and accepts people from different time zones (I'll be in EST hours). Registration costs are $950 USD. WAI is offering one full scholarship. It's made for people who need/want archival skill training, but don't have a formal degree or training.

My data science project received a prestigious honorable mention for Library Juice Press' Vattemare Award! Given annually by Library Juice Press, the Vattemare Award recognizes contributions in the LIS field that are marked by originality, creative energy, and novel combinations of ideas. The primary consideration in selecting the awardee is their creation of new possibilities for libraries and library workers.

From [the press release](https://litwinbooks.com/8181-2/):
>We are also excited to recognize Dana Reijerkerk and kYmberly Keeton with an honorable mention for “Relational Possibilities: A Remix of Aesthetic Forms Through Indigeneity and Blackness.” This project explores how historic collections can be used and made accessible in new ways, in this case highlighting the experiences of African Americans in Philadelphia. Through the use of a variety of digital humanities tools, The Relational Possibilities Project explores how libraries and library workers can  use innovative ways to engage their communities in public history by providing new mechanisms for individuals to see themselves in that history.

My colleague, kYmberly Keeton, and I have been speaking publically about The Relational Possibilities Project all of 2024 at venues like The BitCurator Forum and in the news (see our [Biblio-Notes newsletter post!](https://www.ala.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Biblio-NotesSpring2024-1.pdf)). Relational Possibilities is a meta creative digital work between two researchers, writers, and artists from different races using generative artificial intelligence, video games, community archives, data sets, and digital museum exhibition design.

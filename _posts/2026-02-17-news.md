Come get smarter about cloud-based tech (like databases), digitized images, and more in my newsletter: https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20260217

**Did you know I have a newsletter?** I started it because I didn’t see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on educational opportunities, industry updates, and behind-the-scenes content of my projects.

You blew Looney Mae's mind with over 200 downloads of our demo. This is our first official game as a new indie studio and we're enthused to see so many players interested in our game. It's currently playable on PC, Linux, Mac, and Android and we intend to publish the full version on Steam and Itch.io. 

I came up with the game concept during a typical brainstorm session: one of us says something jokingly and the others' faces light up and they say "Yeah, let's do it!" We made the game demo entirely from scratch for the #SpooktoberVNJam and the full game concept has evolved away from being a VN (visual novel) and more into something atmospheric, point-and-click, and more heavy psychological horror. 

I enjoyed watching Twitch streamers and Youtube VODs for our demo all month long and the jam is finally coming to a close. Voting ends October 27th and we would appreciate ratings and comments! This helps shape the full game as we establish our indie studio's online presence and ship our first Steam game.

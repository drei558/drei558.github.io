My Collaborative Partner kYmberly Keeton and I got accepted to the *6th Interactive Film & Media International Virtual Conference*! The conference is FREE! Register and check out our research!

From the organizing committee: "Your dedication and hard work has certainly paid off, and we are confident that your contribution will significantly enhance the depth and breadth of discussions at our conference."

We're going to talk about our data science project "Relational Possibilities" ~ where we used #artificialintelligence and #machinelearning to make video games, museum exhibitions, datasets, and more! This will be an interactive presentation ~ come ready to play our games and immersive yourself in our exhibitions.

Since 2019 I have freelanced as in data often doing digital asset management (DAM) work. If you're a digital asset manager, you often have to assess and evaluate your content and present this in layman's terms to colleagues and higher ups that often lack the technical data expertise you possess. Before you begin DAM projects you need a planning document that distills the key points, deliverables, and how you're going to get to the final project output. 

I had such a hard time finding something to emulate for documentation when I first started. Even after extensive research, I wasn't seeing any resources targeted specifically at DAM and that left me feeling so frustrated. I ended up creating my own templates that I tweak to fit the client or organization I partner with. 

So here's a free gift for other digital asset managers across all sectors. Grab a copy for yourself of my DAM project plan template on [my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/s/9b7091a637)!

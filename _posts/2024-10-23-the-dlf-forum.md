Thank you for listening to The Creative CoLab present _The Relational Possibilities Project_ in 2024! Your support means the world to us. 

My creative collaborator, kYmberly Keeton, and I presented our _Relational Possibilities Project_ one final time at the DLF Forum. We've met with over 300 people at invited lectures and conferences to talk about the work we did during our LEADING data science fellowship.

Yesterday's session was fun because the attendees were interested in the video game and AI aspects of our Relational Worlds. We fielded some interesting questions about how kYmberly used voice AI in her World and how I incorporated land-water relations research in my own AI-generated imagery from our assigned dataset.

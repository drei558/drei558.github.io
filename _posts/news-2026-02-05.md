In the [new issue of my newsletter](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/20260204), I talk about my background and research in cultural heritage/DAM data issues related to Indigenous collections/content/data. 

Data professionals like archivists, librarians, curators, and IT professionals are expected to have competencies (the ability to apply knowledge/skill) in the complex, systemic data issues related to colonization.

Somehow I've worked on Artificial Intelligence Projects for the last two years. This week wraps up my data science fellowship project from last year. I presented the project for the last time this calendar year at the DLF Forum. This all stems from when I started a long-term AI project to show emotional labor of archivists through AI imagery. 

Read more about my experiences and what research I did with AI in archives in the [latest issue of my decolFutures newsletter](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/2024-10-21).

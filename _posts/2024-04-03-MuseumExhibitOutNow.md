A N N O U N C I N G: the opening of a new digital museum exhibit about the history of Japanese in New York. 

I'm excited to share this work! I've been freelancing with the Digital Museum of the History of Japanese in New York, a born-digital museum with business archives about Japanese and Japanese-Americans in the Metro-NYC area and East Coast! I helped design and install this exhibit and its website UX/UI design.

This is the first of its kind to present images of artworks, Japanese language newspapers, and museum catalogs from over 20 museums and archives in the U.S. and Japan. The exhibit is truly unique because it includes ARTWORKS from regional museums in Japan - this is special considering many Japanese cultural heritage organizations do not have open access digital collections.

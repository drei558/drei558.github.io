I woke up one day a few weeks ago with this absurd idea to make a DnD-style game based on the premise of a character trying to grocery shop without talking to anyone.

You’ll play as Janice who battles it out with fellow grocery shoppers with moves like “glare,” “ignore,” and "bonk.” Janice’s DnD moves are below her character portrait and the grocery store is navigated through the window to the top right. I’m working on designing the constitution (health in DnD rules) in the top left.

Janice's move buttons change color based on if they're usable (blue), pressed (gray), or expended (red) just like in other DnD-style games.

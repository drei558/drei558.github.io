An article I wrote about my work freelancing with [ART library deco](https://artlibrarydeco.space/) was just published in _Metropolitan Archivist_! ðŸ˜„ _Metropolitan Archivist_ is the online publication of the Archivists Round Table of Metropolitan New York with topics on local histories and collections, issues impacting the field, and new projects undertaken within our professional community. 

I talk about my recent Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning project, _Relational Possibilities_, and the creative data science work I'm brewing up with the great kYmberly Keeton like web comics, an AI reference librarian, and a revamped newsletter.

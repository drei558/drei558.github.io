In today's data news, I found an **Art Writing Prize, paid Research Fellowship, and share data tools** to use in libraries, archives, and data research projects: [https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/250605](https://decolfutures.beehiiv.com/p/250605)

**Did you know I have a newsletter?** I started it because I didn't see anyone doing the kind of creative, decentered, sandboxing data work I do. I share news 1-2 times a month on educational opportunities, industry updates, and behind-the-scenes content of my projects.

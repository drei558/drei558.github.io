This past year I gave several public talks on the nexus of the usage of artificial intelligence in cultural heritage institutions and I'm so excited for this talk because I highlight how AI has sparked a reassessment of an archivist's role within the data ecosystem. I also made creepy AI images with Playground.ai to tell a story about how AI affects archives and emotional labor. Perfect for Fall and the Spooktober season.

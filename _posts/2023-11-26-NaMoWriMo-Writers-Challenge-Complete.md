This November I participated in NaMoWriMo's [National Novel Writing Month challenge](https://nanowrimo.org/national-novel-writing-month) to draft an entire novel (50,000 words) in just one month. I'm excited to announce I finished! Check out my name in [NaMoWriMo's winner's circle] (https://nanowrimo.org/winners-circle). My novel draft titled _All Are Welcome_ is based on my itch.io video game characters and concept, [_All Are Welcome_](https://decolfutures.itch.io/all-are-welcome).

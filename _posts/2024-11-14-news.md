My new book chapter is finally out today! Kristen J. Nyitray and I co-wrote a book chapter on user personas, archivists, and the history of emotional labor expected of archivists and archival workers in the United States in this international book published by Bloomsbury Publishing. 

We're one of the few contributors who actually work in archival spaces. Writing this chapter in a history book refreshing. I'm finding that book venues outside data science are the most rewarding writing/research experiences. 

You can get the e-book now on the Bloomsbury website: https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/archives-and-emotions-9781350415201/

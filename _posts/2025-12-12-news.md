I took all the wacky, cartoony energy I gathered all year and threw it inside. My favorite part was doodling the caw character in different styles while having fun.

This year I took on projects for back-end development, database migrations, network security configurations, technical writing, DAM, SQL, Python, and more. I won two highly coveted awards in the cultural heritage sector for my work in archives, AI, and history. And I shipped a Nickelodeon-style indie game and pitched a lot of ideas that didn't get selected.

My books for 2026 are open. I’m looking for remote freelance/consulting, part-time, and contract work doing database migrations, data assessments, digital projects, development/programming, digital asset management, analytics, narrative design, or data storytelling. 

Have a cool project/kind of work not listed here in mind for me? DM me anyway!

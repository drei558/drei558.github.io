I have ten plus years of experience working with and in Indigenous communities on UI/UX Design, decolonization, digital storytelling, and data engineering. I've worked with and in Indigenous communities on the east coast of the U.S. (Seneca, Lumbee, Anishinaabe, Shinnecock), Madagascar (Vezo), Costa Rica (Maleku), and diaspora enclaves in the U.S., South America, and Japan (Okinawan, Ainu).

I was the recipient of the **_2020 Museum Computer Network Emerging Scholar Award_**, the **_2021 University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies Seminar & Workshop Grant_** and was named a **_Library and Information Science Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group Fellow_** in 2023.
